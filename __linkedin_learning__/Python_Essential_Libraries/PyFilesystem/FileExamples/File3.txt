 It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents, except at
occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along
the house-tops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that
struggled against the darkness. â€”Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, Paul
Clifford (1830)
