This script works similar to its previous version, site_checker_v0.py. The main difference 
is that, in this example, you extract the logic of the original outer async with 
statement and encapsulate it in AsyncSession.

In .__aenter__(), you create an aiohttp.ClientSession(), await the .get() response, 
and finally return the response itself. In .__aexit__(), you close the session, which 
corresponds to the teardown logic in this specific case. Note that .__aenter__() and .__aexit__() must return awaitable objects. In other words, you must define them with async def, which returns a coroutine object that is awaitable by definition.

Finally, a common practice when youâ€™re writing asynchronous context managers is to implement the four special methods:
.__aenter__()
.__aexit__()
.__enter__()
.__exit__()

This makes your context manager usable with both variations of with.
