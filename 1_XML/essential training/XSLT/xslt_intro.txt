- eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
- Different than CSS - applies templates to XML data
- Written using XML syntax itself
- Can transform XML into almost anything
- Can perform operations directly on the data

Creating XSLT Stylesheets:
- Defined using the <xsl:stylesheet> root tag
- Typeically contain <xsl:template> tags
- Templates are matched t0 XML tags in the source data
- the content of the template replace the source XML
- template contain other XSLT dierectives
- template can be invoked by name - almost like they were a function

How XSLT works:

XML document + 
XSLT document => XSLT Transformation Engine 
                                => Result document

Common XSLT Elements:

<xsl:stylesheet>
<xsl:template match="xpath expression">
<xsl:value-of select="xpath">
<xsl:attribute>
<xsl:text>
<xsl:for-each select="xpath">
<xsl:if test="condition">
<xsl:choose>
<xsl:when>
<xsl:otherwise>
<xsl:sort select="">






templates with name can be called as if they were a function
